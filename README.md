# BiNaS for TI-84 Plus CE
Biology, Physics and Chemistry resources on the TI-84 Plus family of calculators.

## Important notice about TI Basic limitations
TI Basic has some annoying limitations, like the limited amount of values you can assign to different labels. For this reason, the program might get split into different modules once the initial program has become too large on its own for the calculator and/or TI Basic.
